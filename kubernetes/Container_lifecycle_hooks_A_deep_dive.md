Container lifecycle hooks are mechanisms provided by Kubernetes that enable you to run custom actions before or after specific lifecycle events of a container. These hooks allow to perform tasks such as initializing resources before a container starts or cleaning up resources after it terminates


Container LifeCycle hooks are classified as :

➡️ 𝑷𝒐𝒔𝒕𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒓𝒕: This hook is executed immediately after a container is created and performs tasks:

✅ Initializing databases

✅ Downloading configuration files

✅ Running health checks


➡️ 𝑷𝒓𝒆𝑺𝒕𝒐𝒑: This hook is executed immediately before a container is terminated, performing cleanup tasks such as:

✅ Gracefully shutting down services

✅ Saving application state

✅ Backing up data


The lifecycle hooks are specified by three handlers

-> 𝒆𝒙𝒆𝒄: With this handler, you specify a command or script that runs directly within the container’s primary process. This is ideal for tasks that require you to manipulate the container’s environment from within, like initializing databases (postStart), triggering system-level configuration changes, or performing cleanup tasks during shutdown (preStop)

-> 𝒉𝒕𝒕𝒑𝑮𝒆𝒕: This handler attempts to establish an HTTP connection to a designated endpoint. It’s helpful for verifying if a service within the container is up and running before marking it as healthy. 

-> 𝒕𝒄𝒑𝑺𝒐𝒄𝒌𝒆𝒕: The tcpSocket handler focuses on verifying whether a particular port within the container is open and accepting connections. This is valuable for checking the availability of services like databases, message brokers, or other applications that rely on TCP communication


Container lifecycle hooks provide a powerful mechanism to execute custom logic at specific stages of a container’s lifecycle in Kubernetes. By leveraging these hooks, developers can ensure proper initialization and cleanup of resources, contributing to more efficient container management
